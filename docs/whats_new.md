* Better table conversion with matplotlib

* Option to choose matplotlib to create pandas DataFrame images
* Better capturing large DataFrames

### Using matplotlib to create pandas DataFrames

Some users don't have chrome installed (or cannot get chrome to take screenshots) and therefore were unable to convert pandas DataFrames 
to images. This is solved in version 0.1 with the option to use matplotlib instead.

The images will look slightly different than the screenshots taken by chrome, but should provide a good alternative.
